                                course provider, EdX, I have acquired a range of
                                skills that will set the tone for my career in
                                front-end development.

                                Prior to acquiring my professional
                                qualification, I had undertaken personal coding
                                projects for over 5 years in my spare time. So,
                                why coding? Making the decision to switch
                                careers came because I relocated from London to
                                Lincolnshire, having previously worked as an
                                electronics technician for many years.
